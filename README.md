# Recipes-and-Ratings
## Introduction
Have you ever wondered what makes a recipe truly outstanding? In the age of online cooking platforms, thousands of recipes are rated and reviewed daily, providing a rich dataset to explore. This project seeks to answer the question: **“What kinds of recipes get higher average ratings?”**

Using data from two datasets—one detailing individual recipe information, and the other capturing user interactions such as ratings—we will analyze trends and patterns among top-rated recipes. Our goal is to uncover what distinguishes a 5-star dish from an average one. Are recipes with fewer steps more likely to be highly rated? Do certain ingredients or cuisines consistently perform better? And does the total time to prepare a dish affect its popularity?

Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights that are not only data-driven but also useful for aspiring home chefs, food bloggers, or anyone interested in culinary trends.
